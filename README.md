# Semicolon-Spammer README;

This is the README of ;;;;;;;;. :) <br>
Because everyone (or at least me) loves using semicolons over... *not* using them... and I'm of course referring to JavaScript, which is what this extension was originally built for. <br>
So yes, the extension is approaching a level where you can basically Ctrl+A and run this command to intelligently place semicolons wherever needed in your JavaScript file! >^<

## Features;

;;;;;;;; only has 1 feature: use a command (called `toggleSemicolons` // `Toggle Semicolons`) to add/remove semicolons to the ends of all currently selected lines (or the current line that the cursor is at);

Will only remove if *all* selected lines already have a semicolon at the end;

Will *not* place a semicolon when:
- the current line is empty;
- the current line ends with certain characters;
- the current line ends with a certain character (but does place when that character appears 2 times: e.g. ++/--);
- the current line starts with certain characters;
- the current line contains certain characters (provided they are not part of a string);
- the next line starts with certain characters;
- the (end of the) current line is part of a comment;
- the (end of the) current line is part of a `()`/`[]` closure;
- the (end of the) current line is part of a multi-line string;
- the current line is part of a `{}` closure that is an object;
- the current line ends with a `}` of a closure that is not an object;
In this, the 'certain characters' are defined in the file `filterInfo.ts` in the extension files;
Will eventually make this editable;

## Known Issues;

The closures for `<>` aren't properly detected because of arrow syntax and less than / greater than;
(Which is why for the time being they have been removed;)

All the closure detecting has made the semicolon placing sometimes slightly too slow for my preference (esp. with larger quantities/documents);

## Planned Features;

Make it ignore existing semicolons which are part of comments/strings;

Make the thing intelligent about `<>` closures;

Functions to turn such filters on/off / change which characters/words are affected by them;

Make it so that most filters only work when working in a JS/TS/... file;

Built-in `Ctrl+;` shortcut;
